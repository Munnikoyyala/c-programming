#program print n even numbers

input: 5
output: 2 4 6 8 10 

exp: here we use count(refers to a variable that is used to keep track of the number of times the loop has been executed.)
Here it checks the even number and increment the vaule by 1 up to 5

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int i,n,count;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    i=1;
    count=1;
    while(count<=n){
        if(i%2==0){
            printf("%d ",i);
            count++;
        }
        i++;
    }
}
